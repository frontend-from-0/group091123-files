For managing API keys in your React application created with Create React App (CRA), you’ll want to handle the keys differently based on the environment (development vs. production).

## Development Environment

1. Create Environment Files: In the root of your CRA project, create .env file.
2. Add Environment Variables: Inside this file, you can set your API keys like this:
   `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_development_api_key_here`

Prefixing with **REACT_APP** is mandatory for CRA to expose these variables inside your app.

3. Access Environment Variables: In your React code, access the variable using `process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY`. This value will be replaced appropriately depending on the active .env file when you start your app.

## Production Environment (Vercel)

Setting up Environment Variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your project settings on Vercel.
2. Find the Environment Variables section.
3. Add your environment variable there (e.g., REACT_APP_API_KEY), and set its value to your production API key.
4. Choose whether the variable is for Preview, Production, or both.

Deploying: When you deploy your application, Vercel will automatically use the environment variables you’ve set in the project settings. Your codebase remains the same, i.e., accessing the API key via process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY.

## Security Considerations

Never commit your .env files to version control. Add them to your .gitignore file to prevent them from being uploaded to GitHub or any other version control systems.
For even higher security, especially if you are using sensitive data, consider using secrets management tools or services.
This setup should keep your API keys secure and your setup straightforward, distinguishing clearly between development and production environments.
